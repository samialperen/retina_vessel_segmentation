## Retinal Vessel Segmentation
Two different approach was followed in order to segment retinal vessels. 

### Segmenting Retinal Vessels Using Traditional Image Processing Techniques 
MATLAB image processing toolbox is used to segment vessels using traditional computer vision approaches (edge detection, local threshold, morphological operations etc). Related scripts are [segmentation and auto contrast](https://github.com/samialperen/rop_disease_classification/blob/master/code/segmentation_autocontrast.m) and [segmentation without auto contrast](https://github.com/samialperen/rop_disease_classification/blob/master/code/segmentation_manualconstract.m). 

The approach followed for this purpose:
